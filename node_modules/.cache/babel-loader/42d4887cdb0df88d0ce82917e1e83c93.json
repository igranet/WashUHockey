The team had a sporadic existence due to varying school and student support, until it was formalized in 2016. The team currently competes in the Midwestern Conference. </p>\n                <br></br>\n                <p className=\"text-lg\">Currently, the team consists of roughly 30 members whose backgrounds range widely in hockey experience and location — including Junior A, Prep School Hockey, and other NCAA D-III schools. The team has changed its colors to Red, White, and Grey, in order to match school color changes. \n\nChris Nikonovich currently serves as the teams head coach assisted by Greg Gajewski (GM), Sean Daley (Goalie Coach), Stephan Meyer (Assistant Coach), Jake Koons (Assistant Coach). In the 2021-2022 season Claire Coates is the team EMT. </p>\n                <br></br>\n                \n                <div className=\"flex w-full mx-auto\"><img className=\"w-1/5 mx-auto\" src={achalogo}></img> <img className=\"w-1/6 mx-auto\" src={wucrest}></img></div>\n                <br></br>\n                <p className=\"text-black text-3xl font-bold\">Founding.</p>\n                <p className=\"text-lg\">The team was formally re-established in 2016 following several years of outside-of-conference competition to ensure the teams feasibility. Originally wearing green and white jerseys, the team sported a large \"W\" on the front of the jersey. Michael Dubus would assume the role as Captain in his sophomore year for his outstanding previously demonstrated leadership. Coach Gary Schlottach assumed the role of head coach.\n\nWhile struggling in the first few seasons, the Washington University ice hockey team would eventually win the MACHA championship in Spring of 2019, beating the Bradley Braves 7-1. This win marked also meant that the team would move up to the Silver Division. <img className=\"w-1/3 mx-auto\" src={Champions}></img> </p>\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n                <p className=\"text-black text-3xl font-bold\">About WashU. </p>\n                <div>\n                Washington University in St. Louis is a private institution that was founded in 1853, located in scenic St. Louis. \n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nIt has a total undergraduate enrollment of 7,675, its setting is suburban, and the campus size is 169 acres.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWash U is divided into four schools that serve undergraduate and graduate students, and four graduate schools. \n<br></br>\n​<br></br>\nAmong Wash U’s graduate programs are the top-ranked George Warren Brown School of Social Work, the highly ranked Olin Business School, School of Law, School of Medicine, Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts, School of Engineering and Applied Science and a graduate program in education.​\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWashington University's undergraduate program is ranked 14th by U.S. News & World Report in 2018 and 11th by The Wall Street Journal in their 2021 rankings.
